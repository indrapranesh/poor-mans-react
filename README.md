# Poor Man's React

Welcome to Poor Man's React! In this project, I've built a simple implementation of some core React concepts, including `createElement`, `useState`, and a basic form of concurrent loading with an API call. This project serves as an educational exercise to understand the underlying mechanisms of React and its fundamental building blocks.

## Introduction

This library is a simplified version of React, created to showcase the inner workings of React's core concepts. 

## Implemented Features

This library currently implements the following features:

- `createElement`: Create virtual DOM elements similar to React's JSX syntax.
- `useState`: Manage state within functional components.
- Concurrent loading with API call: Demonstrate concurrent rendering by fetching data from an API.
